# embedded-hoplon-example

This project demonstrates attaching a Hoplon element to a div in a static HTML file.

`assets/index.html` is a static HTML file containing a div with the id `mountpoint`.

`src/app/main.cljs.hl` is a ClojureScript file processed by Hoplon. It contains
an `ns` header instead of `page`, so the Hoplon compiler emits only
ClojureScript, not HTML.

In `src/app/main.cljs.hl`, jQuery is used to find the div to mount to. Then, an
instance of the `counter` component is attached to it.

A [Hoplon][3] project designed to...well, that part is up to you.

## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]

## Usage
### Development
1. Start the `dev` task. In a terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot dev
    ```
    This will give you a  Hoplon development setup with:
    - auto compilation on file changes
    - audible warning for compilation success or failures
    - auto reload the html page on changes
    - Clojurescript REPL

2. Go to [http://localhost:8000][2] in your browser.

3. If you edit and save a file, the task will recompile the code and reload the
   browser to show the updated version.

### Production
1. Run the `prod` task. In a terminal run:
    ```bash
    $ boot prod
    ```

2. The compiled files will be on the `target/` directory. This will use
   advanced compilation and prerender the html.
